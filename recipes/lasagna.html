    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Barilla lasagna recipe is full of layers of delicious ground meat, marinara sauce, and ooey-gooey cheese. It’s the definition of decadence!
        <br><br>
        Having three different components, lasagna is not the easiest thing to make. But it only takes one whiff of this Italian masterpiece to know that it’s worth it. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Bulk Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>Ricotta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>2. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 4 minutes and drain with a colander. Run it through cold water to stop from further cooking. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>3. In a large saucepan, mix sausage or ground beef and 1 1/12 of the marinara sauce. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>4. In a separate bowl, mix Ricotta, 3 1/2 cups of mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and eggs.
        </li>
        <li>5. Grease a lasagna pan or a 9×13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>6. Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce over the baking dish, about 3/4 cup. Layer 3 to 5 lasagna noodles over the sauce. The noodles should only overlap slightly with each other. Layer the cheese mixture of the noodles, followed by the meat sauce.
        </li>
        <li>7. Repeat the layers starting from the noodles to the meat sauce twice. Top the meat sauce with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>8. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>9. Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
