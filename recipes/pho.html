    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) – the little sister of famous Beef Pho, equally delicious but much easier to make! I call it the Vietnamese version of homemade chicken noodle soup made from scratch. Except – dare I say it – so much more exciting!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Aromatics</li>
        <li>Broth</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Char onion & ginger - Heat oil in a 6 litre / 6 quart pot (Note 5) over high heat. Place ginger and onion facedown, leave undisturbed for 2 minutes until they blacken. Turn and leave for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>2. Put everything in pot - Add water and remaining Broth ingredients EXCEPT salt. Bring it a simmer, then lower heat so it's simmering VERY gently with the lid on, but open a crack (Note 6).
        </li>
        <li>3. Simmer gently 1.5 hours. Scoop off scum (dirty foam) that rises to surface once or twice during the simmering.
        </li>
        <li>4. Strain & measure - Remove chicken, then strain broth into a clean pot - you should have 1.5 litres / 1.5 quarts. If you have more, simmer to reduce. If less, top it up with water.
        </li>
        <li>5. Salt broth - Add salt, bring broth to a gentle simmer. Broth should be slightly on the salty side - it dilutes when you add the noodles.
        <li>6. Keep broth warm until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>7. Shred chicken meat, discard bones and skin. (Note 6 Leftover Chicken ideas).
        </li>
    </ol>
